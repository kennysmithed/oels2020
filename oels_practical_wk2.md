## The plan for week 2 practical

For the practical component of week 2 the plan is to learn enough of the basics of jsPsych so we can jump in to building simple experiments in week 3. Remember, the idea is that you do as much of this as you can on your own (which might be all of it or might be none of it!) and then come to the practical drop-in sessions or use the discussion board to get help with stuff you need help with.

*Additional explanatory notes for this practical to be added.*

## Practical tasks for this week

Work through:
- Work through sections 00, 01, 02 and 03 of [Online Experiments with jsPsych tutorial](https://softdev.ppls.ed.ac.uk/online_experiments/index.html).
- Also look at the very first paragraph of [section 04](https://softdev.ppls.ed.ac.uk/online_experiments/jspsych.html), titled "Putting the code in its own file" - literally one paragraph, it just makes the code a bit neater so it helps if you read it now!
