## The plan for week 2 practical

For the practical component of week 2 the plan is to learn enough of the basics of jsPsych so we can jump in to building simple experiments in week 3. Remember, the idea is that you do as much of this as you can on your own (which might be all of it or might be none of it!) and then come to the practical drop-in sessions or use the discussion board to get help with stuff you need help with.

Some things to note as you work through the practical.

- We will be playing with code on the teaching server, `jspsychlearning.ppls.ed.ac.uk`. As soon as I have the class registration list I will ask the techies to create an account for you on there. Until they set that up, you won't be able to access it, but you can still read through the tutorial. Also, you need to be on the University network to log in to the server (to upload files etc) - see instructions in the [Week 2 reading page](oels_reading_wk2.md) on how to access the VPN.
- In section 02, the tutorial recommends using CyberDuck for uploading files to the server - I agree, it's very nice. Just to emphasise, *you don't need to pay for it*, although it will ask you if you'd like to ocasionally. I have bought a license because I use it a lot, if that helps assuage your guilt.
- In section 03 the tutorial runs through some potential editors you can use to view/edit code. I am using Atom on a Mac, it's OK - if you want to use that you might have to download it from [the Atom website](https://atom.io).
- Note that in the jsPsych "hello world" tutorial, the name of the directory they give for the jspsych code might not match the name of the directory for you. In the tutorial it says that you load the various bits of jsPsych code with code like `<script src="jspsych-6.0.5/jspsych.js"></script>`, but for me the downloaded jspsych code is actually in a directory called `jspsych-6` so I had to edit that script call to read `<script src="jspsych-6/jspsych.js"></script>`, just so the browser is looking in the right place. If you try to run the hello world tutorial code and get a bunch of errors telling you that it can't find certain files, this might be the problem.

## Practical tasks for this week

- Work through sections 00, 01, 02 and 03 of [Online Experiments with jsPsych tutorial](https://softdev.ppls.ed.ac.uk/online_experiments/index.html).
- Also look at the very first paragraph of [section 04](https://softdev.ppls.ed.ac.uk/online_experiments/jspsych.html), titled "Putting the code in its own file" - literally one paragraph, it just makes the code a bit neater so it helps if you read it now!

Once you have done these tasks you should be able to access the teaching server, upload code, edit code in something like Atom, and have a (very basic) idea of what a trivial jsPsych "hello world" experiment looks like. Next week we'll look at an actual experiment written in jsPsych. And if you need help getting any of this stuff to work, remember that the practical drop-in sessions and the discussion board are available.
