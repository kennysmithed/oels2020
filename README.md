# oels2020
Online Experiments for Language Scientists, 2020-2021 academic year.

Full content for the course (code walkthroughs etc) in a readable format is currently at https://kennysmithed.github.io/oels2020/, you can find the markdown source and zipped code on the gh-pages branch.

Here on you can inspect individual pieces of code, some of which I had to zip up in the webpage version for convenience of the people downloading them.
