## The plan for week 6

This week we are looking at a paper by my former PhD student Vanesa Ferdinand, presenting work she did as part of her PhD with me and Simon Kirby. The paper describes a frequency-learning experiment, where participants are exposed to variants (in the linguistic condition, synonymous labels for objects) during an observation phase and then attempt to reproduce that variation (e.g. by labelling objects using those labels) in the production phase. The question of interest is under what conditions participants will faithfully reproduce the variation in their input, and when they regularize (e.g. by over-producing the most frequent variant); we manipulated domain (are you learning frequencies of linguistic variants, or non-linguistic variants?) and load (are you tracking a single frequency distribution, or multiple distributions) to see how these affected regularization. As usual In this week's practical you'll get a chance to look at a similar exeriment in jsPsych.


## Reading tasks for this week

Read:
- [Ferdinand, V., Kirby, S., & Smith, K. (2019). The cognitive roots of regularization in language.
*Cognition, 184,* 53-68.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2018.12.002)


As you read this paper and make note of any questions, criticisms or ideas it gives you, and be prepared to discuss these in our reading group session. Once you have read the paper, you also need to work through [this week's practical task](oels_practical_wk4.md).

A couple of things to note as you work through the paper:
